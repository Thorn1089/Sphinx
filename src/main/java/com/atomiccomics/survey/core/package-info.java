/**

 * The survey package aggregates domain classes, such as extensible interfaces
 * and value objects which provide the core functionality of the Sphinx engine.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The two central classes to the Sphinx engine are {@link Question} and {@link Answer}. They provide
 * standard interfaces for representing the data model of a survey.
